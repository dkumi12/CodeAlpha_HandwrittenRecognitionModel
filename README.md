# CodeAlpha Handwritten Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten character recognition, capable of recognizing digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). The model is trained on a dataset of grayscale images (28x28 pixels) and deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload handwritten images for real-time prediction.

The project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha internship and leverages TensorFlow/Keras for model training and Streamlit for the user interface. The repository includes the training script, model files, and a Streamlit app, with the dataset and large image files hosted externally for size management.

## Features
- Recognizes handwritten characters: digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z) (62 classes total).
- Trained on a custom dataset of 37,995 grayscale images (28x28 pixels).
- Web-based interface using Streamlit for easy image uploads and predictions.
- Model trained with CNN architecture, achieving high accuracy on test data.
- Lightweight repository excluding large files, with instructions for accessing external data.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- The following Python packages (install via `pip`):
  - `tensorflow`
  - `streamlit`
  - `pillow`
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
### Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkumi12/CodeAlpha_HandwrittenRecognition.git
cd CodeAlpha_HandwrittenRecognition
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download the Dataset
The training dataset (images stored in the `Images` folder) is not included in this repository due to its large size (~578 MB). Download the dataset from [insert link to external storage, e.g., Google Drive or Dropbox] and place it in the project root as `Images/`. The dataset metadata is provided in `english.csv`, which maps image filenames to their corresponding labels (0-9, A-Z, a-z).

### Optional: Git LFS for Model File
If the `handwritten_character_recognition_model.h5` file is large, it may be tracked with Git LFS. Install Git LFS and pull large files:
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the model from scratch, run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
- Ensure the `Images` folder and `english.csv` are in the project root.
- The script will load and preprocess the images, train the CNN, and save the model as `handwritten_character_recognition_model.h5` and the label encoder as `label_binarizer.pkl`.

### Running the Streamlit App
To use the pre-trained model for predictions, run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`.
- Upload a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten character (PNG, JPG, or JPEG) to get a prediction.

### Example Input
- Upload an image like `img001-001.png` (a handwritten “0”) or a custom handwritten character image.
- The app will display the predicted character and confidence score.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
- Two convolutional layers (32 and 64 filters, 3x3 kernels, ReLU activation).
- Two max pooling layers (2x2 pool size).
- A flatten layer, followed by a dense layer (128 units, ReLU activation) with dropout (0.5).
- An output dense layer with softmax activation for 62 classes (0-9, A-Z, a-z).

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 37,995 grayscale images (28x28 pixels), each representing a handwritten character (0-9, A-Z, a-z). The metadata is stored in `english.csv`, with columns `image` (filename) and `label` (character). The images are stored in the `Images` folder, available externally due to size constraints.
